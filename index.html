  <h2>Day 72 of 100 days of code!</h2>

  <p>Day 72 was all about creating a login system for a diary. I had to create a login system that would allow users to add and view entries in the diary. I used the replit db to store the entries and the username and password. I used the os module to create a menu that would allow the user to add, view, or exit the program. I also used the datetime module to create a timestamp for each entry. </p>
